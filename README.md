# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about electric vehicles across various dimensions, such as vehicle type, make, model, battery specifications, and geographic distribution. With 1.5 million rows, it is a comprehensive resource for understanding the growing EV market.

## KPI Requirements : 
1. Total Vehicles:
•	Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. Average Electric Range:
•	Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
•	Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
•	Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
•	Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
